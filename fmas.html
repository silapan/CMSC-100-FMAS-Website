        <h2>Autobiography</h2>
        <p>
            Hi! My name is Francheska Marie A. Silapan, and I am a graduating BS Computer Science student at the University of the Philippines-Los Banos. 
            I was born in Calamba City, Laguna. I am the fifth and youngest child of our parents, Alicia and Rolando Silapan. 
            I have four siblings: three older sisters and one older brother. I remember when we got our first family computer. 
            I was fascinated about it. Whenever I am alone at our house, I am busy exploring the family computer. 
            As I grew older, I remained interested in computers and their functionalities. Fortunately, I was able to enter the Computer Science field while in college. 
            Throughout my academic journey as a Computer Science student, I have engaged and created projects centered on the various Computer Science topics. I am also a member of a Computer Science Organization 
            named Alliance of the Computer Science Students (ACSS). As I venture more into the deeper world of computer science, I just know that I will delight in its greatness.
